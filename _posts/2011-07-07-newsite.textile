Hey there. So, this' my new site, ya like?
Once again had to try out some new bells and whistles; jekyll, liquid, textile, yaml etc. stuff that you need for GitHub Pages.

Honestly I thought it'd been kind of a drag having to learn so much at once just for a static site, especially since I already have to bounce between dozens (seriously, counted them) of different languages and markups all day long.
But in the end all it really took was running @jekyll --server --auto@ and everything worked within half an hour, and I love it!
